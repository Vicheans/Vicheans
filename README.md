# My Profile: Victor Daniel Olateju

Hello there, I'm Victor from Nigeria, a Biomedical engineer and a Full-Stack Web Developer. I have a hands-on experience with a variety of web technologies such as Perl, PHP, Java, Python, Javascript, MySQL and MongoDB, however I love working with Javascript as it allows for the development of Full-Stack applications in a single language, preferrably the MERN + GraphQl stack.   
I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks like React, Django etc, spending less time on Social media because I spend most of my time programming. Hey! I'm not anti-social, though an Introvert but I think I have a Twitter page right here https://twitter.com/_Vicheans?s=09
